 # Layout
 A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer:

## Content
> The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

1. column (often used for mobile browsers)
2. column (often used for tablets and laptops)
3. column layout (only used for desktops)

 - Controlling the position of elements
 - Creating site layouts
 - Designing for different sized screens
## The `position`
> property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky)

### Floating Elements.
> The `float property` is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
> The `clear property` specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

The float property can have one of the following values:
1. left - The element floats to the left of its container
2. right - The element floats to the right of its container
3. none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
4. inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

#### Screen Sizes
> Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

#### Fixed Width Layouts
> Fixed width layout
designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
##### Layout Grids
> The Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning
