### Functional programming 
- a programming paradigm _a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs_
  1. **Pure functions** 
     - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
     - It does not cause any observable side effects
     - **Pure functions benefits**
       - easier to test codes
  2. **impure functions** 
     - with global var
     - readings external files
     - random number generator
  3. **Immutability** 
     - Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
  4. **referential transparency** 
     - pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
  5. **Functions as first-class entities** 
     - refer to it from constants and variables
     - pass it as a parameter to other functions
     - return it as result from other functions
  6. **Higher-order functions** 
     - takes one or more functions as arguments, or
     - returns a function as its result
## Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!)
**Strategies**
_There are no absolutes when it comes to clean code — there's always an edge case!_
1. **Return** early from functions
2. **Cache** variables so functions can be read like sentences
3. **Check** for Web **APIs** before implementing your own functionality
```function cacheBust(url) {
  return url.includes('?') === true ?
    `${url}&time=${Date.now()}` :
    `${url}?time=${Date.now()}`
}
// Refactor into ->
function cacheBust(url) {
  // This throws an error on invalid URL which stops undefined behaviour
  const urlObj = new URL(url);
  urlObj.searchParams.append('time', Date.now); // Easier to skim read
  return url.toString();
}
```
## modules 
1. **seperate** the **js** files to make the codes eaiser to read
2. at the second file **module.exports=_the function you need to use on the other file_** (at the end of the file)
3. at the bigging of the first file **const variable name to be used(pointer to the file) = require('./filename.js')**
4. use the pointer as constructor function **(basic())**...
   **run js files on the terminal using node (file.js)**
5. **make** helper js file that contain another thing can be used in the 1st file and **module.exports= function**
6. **put** the require in the file used in
   `make an empty object in the helper file and store all the functions in it and export the object it is much easiea
