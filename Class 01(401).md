## Pain vs. Suffering
> I am well aware of the amount of suffering that I will face due to learning something new and distinct from something unknown to many, of value and a measure of appreciation that I will receive later. I previously had this experience while undergoing an intensive course at Al Hussein Technical University. I just hope not to face some force majeure that hinders the course of learning

> Please, our teachers
Providing support and knowledge as much as possible in order to help us overcome the suffering and this is something we found greatly in previous levels
