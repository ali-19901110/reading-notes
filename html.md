## What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet.
 The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.


Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element,
 though many people also refer to it as a tag. 
Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web.
> HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.
> Markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., <footnote>), and content is everything else
