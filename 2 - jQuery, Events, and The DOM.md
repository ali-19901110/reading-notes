# HTML5 EVENTS
`Events` are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). 
- DOMContentLoaded :is event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
- hashchange :  event is fired when the fragment identifier of the URL has changed 
- beforeun load : event is fired when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded.
