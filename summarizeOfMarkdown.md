## Meaning : is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document,for example formating words and creating tables ,Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.


*why we use it?*
1. **It’s easy**
The syntax is really simple. If you know how to compose a hashtag or make an emoticon, you can use Markdown.

2. **It’s fast**
The simple format saves a significant amount of time when thinking about formatting and aesthetics. With Markdown you can focus on the content, not on the shape. It speeds up the workflow of everything, from development to management tasks.

3. **It’s multi-platform**
With Markdown your documents are cross-platform by nature. You can edit them in any plain text editor, or directly on GitHub. There are also a wide-range of Markdown editors out there

Example:
It's very easy to make some words
| word | Syntax | result |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| bold |** ** | **bold** |
| italic | * * | *italic*|
