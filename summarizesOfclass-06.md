# OBJECT
WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names.

- *If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property*
- *If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.*

## Example :
> In real life, a car is an object.
1. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop.
2. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
3. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

### Accessing Object Properties
> You can access object properties in two ways:
1. objectName.propertyName `Example:person.lastName;`
2. objectName["propertyName"] `Example:person["lastName"];`

### Accessing Object Methods
*objectName.methodName()*`Example:name = person.fullName();`

**Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!**

## WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?
 that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
