### 5 Steps to Build a Strong Team
1. Focus on roles.
> A thorough selection process for picking your team members has greater long-term benefits, even if this means you spend more time recruiting than you’d like to. Hiring someone
just to have bodies in the room can harm your team. Companies that do this wind up becoming a revolving door.

2. Value each role.
> With each team member bringing something special to the table, treating each role as an essential part of your operation is also crucial. Each team member should feel like
their job matters, without ever asking themselves, “Why am I even here?” 

3. Communicate.
>  It’s difficult to feel like you are part of a team when everybody has information that hasn’t been shared with you yet or when team members don’t fill each other in on what 
they’re working on. Keep a level of transparency whenever possible with all team members.

4. Set goals.
> It’s important to note that these goals should be realistic so that you and your team don’t feel like you are working for a lost cause. Having milestones and deadlines can 
give team members opportunities to help each other out and band together for success.

5. Celebrate successes and failures.
> Celebrating your successes and milestones also brings your team together and allows everyone to see that when they work together, great things can happen. If someone does
a great job at something, give them a shout out in front of the rest of the team so that every effort is seen and appreciated. This also helps each person to feel visible
and that what they’re doing has an impact. In contrast, if your team fails at something, come together to redirect your efforts or turn it into something positive. Don’t throw
anyone under the bus or turn a damage-control discussion into a blame game. This never helps anybody.
