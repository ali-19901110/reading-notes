# Comparison and logical operators
> **Comparison operators** : operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==
> **Logical operators** : operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: &&, ||, and !.

## Comparison Operators:

1. Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
2. Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
3. Equal to (==) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

## Logical operators :

1. && (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.
2. || (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).


# Loops: while and for
> We often need to repeat actions
## The “while” loop:While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is executed
> The while loop has the following syntax:
`while (condition) {
  // code
  // so-called "loop body"
}`
## The “for” loop
> The for loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.

It looks like this:
`for (begin; condition; step) {
  // ... loop body ...
}`
