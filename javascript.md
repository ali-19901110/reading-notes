## what is the JS ?
### JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (*HTML* and *CSS*) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area
> if you want to learn *JS* you should have background with *HTML&&CSS*

#### how to access content ?
- Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page.
-  Select any elements that have a c1ass attribute with a value of note.
- Find out what was entered into atext input whose id attribute has avalue of emai1.

##### Rules for Naming Variables
1. The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). You can't use a number as the first character.
2. The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. You can't use any other characters, including spaces, symbols, and punctuation marks.
3. As with the rest of JavaScript, variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable named Interest_Rate is treated as an entirely different variable than one named interest_rate.
3. There's no limit to the length of the variable name.
5. You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language and that can't be used for variable names because doing so would cause confusion (or worse). Note, too, that JavaScript also has many keywords that should be avoided as well.
