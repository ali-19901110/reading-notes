# Code in a Content Management System
> is something you definitely want. Why? Because a content management system, or a CMS, helps you manage your website’s content without having to touch the code. That’s a good thing. It means you can make updates to your site without having to touch your code.

## Looking at How Other sites are Built!
> the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages

### Headings
> *HTML has six "levels" of headings*

### Horizontal rules and Line breaks.
> There are two tags that can be used to control the layout of your page.

1. `Horizontal Rule <hr>`
2. `Line break <br> -- inserts a end of line where it appear`
> `Neither have a closing tag or associated text`

### Semantic Markup:
> There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages — they are known as semantic markup.
- `<strong>`
- `<em>`
- `<blockquote>`
- `<q>`

# HTML5: Multiple Audio Sources
> HTML5 introduced new tags for embedding multimedia files directly to your webpage. One of them was `<audio>`,
which allows embedding an HTML5 music player with audio controls straight into the webpage

# There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

# JavaScript
> Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
> You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing `</script>` tags *(but it is better to put scripts in their own files)*.

#### JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

* Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
* Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.
* Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.
* Writing into the browser console, `using console.log()`.
